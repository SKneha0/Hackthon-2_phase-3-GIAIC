## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the backend tasks generation work

## Response snapshot

Created a PHR for backend tasks generation work with appropriate metadata and routing to the general prompt history directory.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR for tracking backend tasks generation work
- 🧪 Tests: None needed for this PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created one PHR file in history/prompts/general/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Future backend development tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper PHR creation follows the template and guidelines

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard PHR creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with backend task implementation following SDD principles
